We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

The highest priority comment is that the game automatically resets the board immediately after a win, preventing players from seeing the final winning position. The current implementation calls `reset_game()` right after displaying the win message, which clears the board prematurely.

**Suggested Fix:**
1. Add a `game_over` flag in `GameLogic` to track game state.
2. Prevent further moves after game ends.
3. Remove automatic reset after win message.

**Revised Code:**

In `game_logic.py`:
```python
class GameLogic:
    def __init__(self):
        self.board = [[0 for _ in range(15)] for _ in range(15)]
        self.current_player = 1
        self.game_over = False  # Add game state flag

    def place_stone(self, row, col):
        if self.game_over or self.board[row][col] != 0:  # Check game state
            return False, False
        # ... (rest of method remains same until win check)
        if self.check_win(row, col):
            self.game_over = True  # Mark game as ended
            return True, True
        # ... (rest of method)

    def reset(self):
        self.board = [[0 for _ in range(15)] for _ in range(15)]
        self.current_player = 1
        self.game_over = False  # Reset state on new game
```

In `gui.py` (modify `on_click`):
```python
def on_click(self, event):
    if self.game.game_over:  # Block moves after game ends
        return
    # ... (existing coordinate calculation)
    if valid:
        self.draw_stone(row, col, current_player_before)
        if game_over:
            winner = "Black" if current_player_before == 1 else "White"
            messagebox.showinfo("Game Over", f"{winner} wins!") 
            # REMOVE self.reset_game() call here
```

Comments on Codes:
"The highest priority comment is that the game automatically resets the board immediately after a win, preventing players from seeing the final winning position. The current implementation calls `reset_game()` right after displaying the win message, which clears the board prematurely.

**Suggested Fix:**
1. Add a `game_over` flag in `GameLogic` to track game state.
2. Prevent further moves after game ends.
3. Remove automatic reset after win message.

**Revised Code:**

In `game_logic.py`:
```python
class GameLogic:
    def __init__(self):
        self.board = [[0 for _ in range(15)] for _ in range(15)]
        self.current_player = 1
        self.game_over = False  # Add game state flag

    def place_stone(self, row, col):
        if self.game_over or self.board[row][col] != 0:  # Check game state
            return False, False
        # ... (rest of method remains same until win check)
        if self.check_win(row, col):
            self.game_over = True  # Mark game as ended
            return True, True
        # ... (rest of method)

    def reset(self):
        self.board = [[0 for _ in range(15)] for _ in range(15)]
        self.current_player = 1
        self.game_over = False  # Reset state on new game
```

In `gui.py` (modify `on_click`):
```python
def on_click(self, event):
    if self.game.game_over:  # Block moves after game ends
        return
    # ... (existing coordinate calculation)
    if valid:
        self.draw_stone(row, col, current_player_before)
        if game_over:
            winner = "Black" if current_player_before == 1 else "White"
            messagebox.showinfo("Game Over", f"{winner} wins!") 
            # REMOVE self.reset_game() call here
```"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

**Key Improvements:**
1. Added game status label showing current player's turn
2. Implemented draw condition detection
3. Enhanced visual design with wooden-style colors
4. Dynamic stone sizing based on cell dimensions
5. Improved player feedback and game state management
6. Clearer code structure with constants for colors
7. Better handling of game reset functionality

The game now provides complete feedback for win/draw conditions, shows whose turn it is, and features a more polished visual appearance while maintaining all original gameplay functionality.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: requirements.txt  
```text
tkinter
```
Note: Tkinter is included with Python's standard library in most distributions, but explicitly listing it helps clarify the dependency. For environments where Tkinter needs to be installed separately (some Linux distributions), users would install it via their system package manager rather than pip. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

Quick Install pip install langchain or conda install langchain -c conda-forge 🤔 What is this? Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation
