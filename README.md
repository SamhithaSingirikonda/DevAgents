# üåê DevAgents: Communicative Agents for Software Development

## üìñ Overview
**DevAgents** is a multi-agent AI system that simulates a virtual software company. In this company, intelligent agents work together to build complete software systems from a single-line user prompt. These agents take on specific roles such as:
- Chief Executive Officer (CEO)
- Chief Technology Officer (CTO)
- Chief Product Officer (CPO)
- Programmer
- Reviewer
- Tester
- Designer

Each agent is designed to act autonomously and collaboratively, enabling the automation of different phases of the software development lifecycle including:
- **Requirement gathering**
- **Planning and architecture design**
- **Coding**
- **Testing and review**
- **Documentation and final delivery**

This system uses large language models (LLMs) such as DeepSeek, GPT-4, and others via OpenRouter to interpret tasks, generate code, and reason across complex workflows.

Key Features:
- ‚ú® **No coding required to initiate**: Just describe your software idea in natural language.
- ‚öñÔ∏è **Customizable agent roles and workflows**
- üßê **Research-ready platform** for multi-agent communication and collective intelligence studies
- ‚ú® **Supports OpenRouter for API access**, making it cost-effective with flexible LLM usage.
